Following is the coding exercise that you need to complete. Please let me know
if you need any clarification on the requirements or the problem statement.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any clarifications.

Problem Statement:

Design and Implement a system to determine unused/underutilized VM's in a
private cloud for optimizing the capacity usage of the cloud. For sake of
simplicity, we will only use the CPU usage, Memory usage and disk usage to
determine a VM’s utilization. Once we collect the data, the system should be
able to determine the VM’s that are under-utilized and list them for
reclamation.

Deliverables:

The final product needs to a working application written in a language of your
choice that when executed will determine underutilized VM’s. The program should
at least take the following parameters as input: Number Of VM’s. (The program
can use processes or threads to mimic VM’s.).  CPU, Memory and Disk Thresholds
that determines whether a VM is under-utilized. (For instance, you could say CPU
below 10%, Memory below 20%, and Disk below 10% is considered as
under-utilized.) Total time you want the program to run in minutes.  Once the
program is executed with the above inputs, it needs to keep running and collect
data from the VM’s every minute and store that data locally. After the program
finishes its execution, it will collect all the data and can use a simple
average to determine the under-utilized VM’s. 

 The deliverables should also include the following: Documentation that explains
 your solution.  Documentation on setting up your code on our local box and
 executing it to see the output.  If some requirements are unclear and you would
 like to make some assumptions on your side, please state them clearly in the
 documentation.

 Things considered while grading: Use of OOP Principles.  The solution should be
 scalable across thousands of VM’s deployed in the cloud.  Documentation and
 Blueprints around your solution.

 Time: Since you will need some time to design and implement this coding task,
 you can take the next 3-5 days to implement it completely.
